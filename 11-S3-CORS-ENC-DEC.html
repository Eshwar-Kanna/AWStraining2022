Launch an instance        𝐰𝐞𝐛𝐬𝐢𝐭𝐞 𝐀    

Create a bucket         𝐰𝐞𝐛𝐬𝐢𝐭𝐞 𝐁       - Upload   files  1.index.html    2 error.html    -    create a policy  allowing for   only get Object


using javascript   we fetch data  of extra.html  in  index.html    so that we can see the data of extra.html in index.html    
          here  index.html  is called  Origin   and to fetch    teh data from one webpage to another  CORS   should be enabled in the website from the data is fetching
        in AWS  enable the 𝐂𝐎𝐑𝐒 of the file in bucket form its permission



                                          𝐄𝐍𝐂𝐑𝐘𝐏𝐓𝐈𝐎𝐍 𝐀𝐍𝐃 𝐃𝐄𝐂𝐑𝐘𝐏𝐓𝐈𝐎𝐍  


Encryption  is of two types    

1. 𝐒𝐒𝐄 (server side encryption )    -    SSE S3    ,  SSE KMS 

2.  𝐂𝐒𝐄  (  client side encryption )     -   CSE


Upload a file  by enabling  the Encryption of  SSE S3    and even without having the encryption key we can delete the file  


We can Encrypt  the Bucket  so that Every  file  uploaded in It  will be Encrypted


we can create an ENVIRONMENT   using  Bucket  Policies that the  Bucket can only allow the files if they are encrypted  using the mentioned specific type of ALGO  



    𝐀𝐔𝐃𝐈𝐓 𝐋𝐎𝐆    :   the Resource used to check all the activity  of the bucket . enable the logging and provide a bucket to store the records then we get 

              all the logs of the bucket in the mentioned bucket as the path of logs  . it may taked time to reflect logs in the bucket

For   Getting or Doownloading the data  AWS   charges .  but to make not to charge for GET we should enable 𝐑𝐞𝐪𝐮𝐞𝐬𝐭 𝐏𝐚𝐲𝐬 
 

        𝐎𝐛𝐣𝐞𝐜𝐭 𝐋𝐨𝐜𝐤   

        we use this resource to fix some period of time to a bucket or file so that no one can delete it till the period of time ends and it can only be done 
              only through   CLI  not GUI

    𝐀𝐦𝐚𝐳𝐨𝐧 𝐒𝟑 𝐆𝐥𝐚𝐜𝐢𝐞𝐫   :   Volut  Lock  -  to lock the file for  aperiod of time 

          AES256   Is an  algo used for the Encryption  and decryption 


SSE S3  Encryption    is completely    managed by the Client   who    specify   while  Uploading   and it gives  to http  header  which is hidden
