                                            𝐃𝐍𝐀𝐓 ( Destination Network Address Translation )  :  public =>  private  :   destination Ip of router which is public is replaced by private ip of instance


      for the internal connectivity of devices   we use switch  but to connect to outer world we use Routers 

𝐃𝐢𝐬𝐚𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐫  𝐑𝐞𝐜𝐨𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐲   is  the backup of VPC in other region 

the Ip address of router and the instance from which we are connecting to internet should be in same range 

create  a VPC   

create  4 subnets   2  as public  and each in each different region     and  2  as private  each in each different region 

Launch an instance in public subnet and enable public assign 

𝐃𝐇𝐂𝐏  is the server that provide ip address

to connect to public subnet from outer world we use Iternet gateway and attach it to the VPC   and create a routing table and associate the public subnets
  to the router  only then we can able to connect to this public Ip's from out of VPC

Launch an instance in the private subnet    we can able connect to this instance using its private Ip  inside an instance running in the public subnet of same vpc 
          the public subnet in which we can connect to the private subnet is known as Bastion Host  or Jump server


and we cannot connect to the private subnet from out of VPC
