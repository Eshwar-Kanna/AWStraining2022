                𝐍𝐀𝐓
                                            𝐃𝐍𝐀𝐓 ( Destination Network Address Translation )  :  public =>  private  :   destination Ip of router which is public is replaced by private ip of instance


      for the internal connectivity of devices   we use switch  but to connect to outer world we use Routers 

𝐃𝐢𝐬𝐚𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐫  𝐑𝐞𝐜𝐨𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐲   is  the backup of VPC in other region 

the Ip address of router and the instance from which we are connecting to internet should be in same range 

create  a VPC   

create  4 subnets   2  as public  and each in each different region     and  2  as private  each in each different region 

Launch an instance in public subnet and enable public assign 

𝐃𝐇𝐂𝐏  is the server that provide ip address

to connect to public subnet from outer world we use Iternet gateway and attach it to the VPC   and create a routing table and associate the public subnets
  to the router  only then we can able to connect to this public Ip's from out of VPC

Launch an instance in the private subnet    we can able connect to this instance using its private Ip  inside an instance running in the public subnet of same vpc 
          the public subnet in which we can connect to the private subnet is known as Bastion Host  or Jump server


and we cannot connect to the private subnet from out of VPC  


  But  if  the instance having private Ip should be connected to Internet and internet should not be connected toi the instance having private Ip  we use  𝐍𝐀𝐓

Launch an instance in private subnet  and to make this pingable to public instance  we use a NAT Gateway  

                        
                          𝐍𝐀𝐓 𝐈𝐧𝐬𝐭𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞𝐬           -   manual 
          𝐒𝐍𝐀𝐓
                          𝐍𝐀𝐓 𝐆𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐰𝐚𝐲            -   Automatic 

        NAT gateway should be always in a public subnet  to make any private instances access to internet

        Every  private instance have  a router which helps in connecting to the public subnets  .  but  through  editing route  bound rules 

        Instead  editing we create a Route  table and attach   it to the required  Subnet

if we launch any instance in our custom  VPC in a private subnet   we dont   get  public dns name bydefault   but which is automated in default VPC  

        to have such enabling in our custom VPC  .  in VPC - actions   -  edit dns hostname   and  Enable  it 

         and we can provide the same settings  in subnet so that any instance launched in that subnet will be auto assigned with a public IP
