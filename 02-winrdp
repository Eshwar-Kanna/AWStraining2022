we connect to the aws linux instance remotely using ssh 

to connect to the windows instance remotely we use RDP 

user   -------------->  ssh   --------------->   Linux 

user   -------------->  RDP  --------------->   windows 

  

each time we restart the instance it changes the IP address  but to make Ip unique  we use EIP

      EIP   is chargeble by AWS   when it is not allocated to the running instance and it doesnot charges only when it is in use and the instance to which attached in running state
