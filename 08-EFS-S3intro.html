EFS  is the service  where we can create the file system 

if the hard disk (EBS) in  1a  And instance in 1b   then   both cannot be connected 

EFS   provides Replication which improves Durability and Availability


Create an EFS   by applying the required features while creating 

Launch an instance using this EFS hard disk 

By default the security groups are added to the instance when the EFS is attached to th instance 

we can mount the EFS to the mUltiple instances with specific permissions 

EFS  cannot be attached to Windows since NFS is not used in Windows 


𝐒𝟑  -   𝐁𝐮𝐜𝐤𝐞𝐭  (  folder )  -  𝐎𝐛𝐣𝐞𝐜𝐭  ( file )

upload a file in  the bucket  

bydefault it can only accessed privately  but to provide access to public we create a Presigned URL   for a specific duration of time 

EFS   has the capability of using it as  SCM   𝐜𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐫𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐳𝐞𝐝 𝐬𝐭𝐨𝐫𝐚𝐠𝐞  which cannot be provided by  EBS   and S3  

    EBS  cannot be connected to instances in other region  thus cannot  be used as centralized storage
    S3   can be connected to instances globally but it is not a file system  where the servers connects to files for the data

We can also  give 𝐑𝐞𝐚𝐝 𝐨𝐧𝐥𝐲 𝐚𝐜𝐜𝐞𝐬𝐬  to the EFS   so that the users attached to this EFS  can only read the data but cannot write 

The access we modify for EFS  only works when the drive is mounted after the access created but the access will not works for the instances which are connected 
    with EFS before creating the ACCESS

to apply the access  we should unmount the drive and reattach   .  we can attach the volume directly using the command from the ATTACH   instead detaching and attaching
