         ASG   (  Auto scaling  Group  )  --->   Edit  ----->  Desired  Capacity ( 2 ) 

           then  it  auto   launch  two  instances  and  attach  to  the  target Group  in  ALB .  Connect to  each  instance  and add  data in html folder 


      copy   dns  of  ALB  and Connect  from   Browser  and  we  connect  to  Instances 


ASG  ---->  select  Existing   --->  Automatic  Scaling   --->  Dynamic  Scaling  --->  Create Policy  (  target tracking  policy  , mytarget  , CPU utilization  , 50  ) and  create 

as  soon  as the  limit exceeds  then  ALB Launch one  more instance  . it  launches  as the  load  balances 

An  alarm  is  created in  Cloud Watch and  that gives info  to  ALB  .

we  use  yes  command from  stress to increase load  of  CPU  

amazon-linux-extras   install   epel  

    yum install stress   -y

yes

Bydefault   when  we  create  Dynamic Scaling  it  creates  two  alarms one is to launch when exceeds and the other to terminate when  lower  the limit 

=>  caching  database  ------>  redis  ( for  centralized  storage of multiple instances )

Traget Groups  ---->   Attributes ----> Edit  ---->  Enable ---> Enable  Stickness (  load balancer cookie  ,  1 min  ) and  save 

when  stickness   enabled  then  when a client connect  to  a  Load Balancer it  assign  to one instance and 
            when  the  same client  connects to  LB  it will  assign to  the same instance

Now  connect to  webpage with  dns and  refresh then  even though  we  refresh  for  multiple times we  will  be connected to  same  instance 

=> stickness  time  is  to define the time to what extent  of time the browser should hold the cookies and keep connection to same instance
