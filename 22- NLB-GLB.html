    =>  it is used when the maximum number of requests hit the srver at an instant 
    
    
    
                                              ALB               TG  Search  
    client   --------->  NLB  -------->       ALB 
                                              ALB               TG  Mail
                                              
                                              
      NLB  is  given  an EIP  and  IP  of  ALB  is  dynamic 
      
      NLB  is much  faster  than   ALB 
      
      
      
  *   creating  an  NLB  
  
        mynalb  --->  internet facing  --->  IPV4  --->   mylwvpc  ----->  public  subnet ( for subnet we have an option to use  if needed  )  ----->  TCP 80
                          --->  in Target Group  Create  (    ALB , VPC , HTTP  , / , ALB  , and assign  created  tg  )  
                                                                    
                                                                    
  *  creating  Gateway Load Balancer 
  
          It acts as IPS / IDS  that secure the server from  the mallicious  data in network  packets  
          
          
                                                    ALB           TG 1 
          client  --->   GLB  --->  NLB   ---->         
                                                    ALB           TG 2 
                                                                    
                                                                    
            createing  GLB  is similar  to  all above  but  in  IP  Listener  Routing  while  creating  TG  it  Should  support  GREVE  protocal  and  Enable it
