    𝐄𝐁𝐒 𝐎𝐩𝐭𝐢𝐦𝐢𝐳𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧     :     To verify the supported resources for each instance we use optimization


The max no of IOPS   are  2,60,000


𝐀𝐖𝐒 𝐁𝐚𝐜𝐤𝐮𝐩     is one way of can be done only for the dedicated instances and for all other insatnces we use  𝐒𝐧𝐚𝐩𝐬𝐡𝐨𝐭  which is another way of backup of 
                      instances 

𝐒𝐧𝐚𝐩𝐬𝐡𝐨𝐭   :   Backup    / Clone Data    -  point in time backup

If the data gets backup everyday the storage becomes double each day which is very expensive and the computation or process becomes slow  to overcome 
such issue we use Snapshot 

select a hard disk and create  snapshot  and create a volume from this snapshot and this volume can be attached to another  instance or other Hard disk
By the above way we can attach similar volume to multiple instances

Back up of data only that is changed or added to the previous version  instead  the  complete data repeatedly  is known as 𝐈𝐧𝐜𝐫𝐞𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐁𝐚𝐜𝐤𝐮𝐩 and added
data called   𝐅𝐥𝐚𝐠


Here if we create a volume from the second snapshot which is created after adding some data in the first snapshot  we can see the complete data which
is in the first and the data added in second  instead only showing the data which added since we have created volume from second snapshot  only because 
The complete data will be stored in S3 and this provide the data of first snapshot to the second snapshot  when the volume is created from the second snapshot
