                      human     -  console / webUI    -  user   and  password 
    AWS   
                      App / Program    - webapp  /  CLI  ( SDK )   -  Access key 


IAM user 

    Identity  ->   Account  Verification              Access  ->  power or policy of  ID 

permission  we give to the user  called policy  

->  we create  sub users to manage same particular  service 
->  pre created policies given by the AWS to a user called AWS managed policies 


                    AWS managed 
policy type         customer  managed 
                    Inline 


Instead  of giving  Administration  power  to the user  we can give  power user  that have all similar except IAM service 

Billing  Dashboard   can only  accessed  to root  Account 

Creating  custom policy

      in  policies  ->  AWS  power   ->  we  can see  the code in JSON   

the policy  can be given to  specific  resources  like  Bucket  and  other

After  giving  the  custom policy we  can attach  this  policy  to  the multiple  users 

->  we  can also  create  policy  for  particular  object  like  instance  , bucket 
->  bucket  policy  can be attached only to  s3 
->  inline  policy   is  same as creating Custom policy   but  attached to only one user
->  instead  of  giving similar policy to multiple user  we  can  create  a group  and attach  ploicy  to that group
->  we use account  setting  to setup  password policy
