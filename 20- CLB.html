   A load balancer in AWS is a service that distributes incoming application traffic across multiple registered targets,
            such as EC2 instances, Lambda functions, and containers, in different availability zone


CLB  :  The Classic Load Balancer is a connection-based balancer where requests are forwarded by the load balancer without “looking into” any of these requests. 
            They just get forwarded to the backend section.

ALB  :  The Application Load  Balancer  route the client request to the target based on the path of URL  the client request from . 

NLB  :  It is used when maximum no.of  request hits at instant 

GLB  :  It acts  and  IPS  /  IDS  that secure the server from Malicious  data from the  network  traffic 

=>  the  servers that are running behind which  are  directly  not  accessed to  the  clients  are  called  Backend  Servers 
=>  the servers that  are directly connected  to the  clients  are called Frontend servers

Here the Load Balancer  is  a frontend  server  &  instances are  Backend 

Increasing  Instances  ---------   scale out  
decreasing Instances  -----------  scale in 


=>  LB  has  the  capability of  health  Check 
=>  LB  has inbuilt  Feature of  Reverse Proxy
=>  LB is  also  said  to  be Register



=>  AWS  has  Elastic  Load Balancer 

Go  to  VPC   --->  Lauch  a private  and publc  subnets in each AZ   of  1a  and 1b  
Launch  a private instance  in  private  subnet   1a 
Launch  another private  instance  in  private subnet  1b 

allow  all traffic in security  group  for  both 

Provide  different  data  in  index.html  for  both  instances  

    for  instance   in  1a 
                                        sudo  sh  -c  " echo  ' iam  from a  '  >  index.html "
    for instance  in  1b 
                                        sudo  sh  -c  " echo  ' iam  from b  '  >  index.html "


we   use above  format  where  sudo  &  >  to be used in a single command 

Go  to  Load Balancer  and  create  CLB  

           Name  ;  select  VPC  ; ( HTTP  ;  Lbport 8080  ;   instance port  80 ) ; select public subnets of both 1a and 1b ; create new sg ; 
                  configure health check  ( HTTP , 80 , /index.html ) ( 5,10,2,4,)  ;  add both private instances ;   create  



=>  we  have to create  a Load Balancer  in only  public  subnet  not i private  and  add only private instances 

=>  Using  the Load  Balancer Ip  and port 8080  (frontend )  we  can  connect to  the Instance  (Backend)   or  the  DNS  name 

=>  as  we refresh the page  we notice the connection  to  both  instances  each time 

=>  Edit  inbound  rule of  instances  and  provide  the  Security  Group  of  Load  Balancer  to  allow only  Load Balaner  to connect to targets 

=>  we  give  security  group  as the source instead  Ip of instances  since  the Ip  of instance changes when its restarted 



        Interval  time  :  ping  to check  health after every mentioned time 

        Unhealthy Threshold  : Confirms  by  pinging for  no.of  times  we  mention 

        Healthy  threshold  :  Confirms  its  healthy by  pinging  no  of  times  we  mention 

   copy  the  DNS  of  Load  Balancer  and use its  port  8080  we can  access to  the  Instances  randomly  

=>  we  can  write  inbound  rule with  Security  Group  

=>  CLB  is  a Transport  Layer  LB  and works  on port number  but  can't  Route
