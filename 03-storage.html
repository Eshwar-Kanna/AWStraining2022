To attach a storage for an instance   it requires following operations 

            𝟏. 𝐇𝐚𝐫𝐝 𝐝𝐢𝐬𝐤
            𝟐. 𝐏𝐚𝐫𝐭𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧
            𝟑. 𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐦𝐚𝐭
            𝟒. 𝐀𝐭𝐭𝐚𝐜𝐡 𝐭𝐨 𝐚𝐧𝐲 𝐝𝐫𝐢𝐯𝐞


The size of a storage i sdefined in GiB   not GB
    1 GiB   = 1024  MiB


                        -   Linux       -     ext4    -    mountpoint
Partition formats   
                        -  windows       -    ntfs     -   drives

𝐒𝐓𝐀𝐀𝐒        :    storage as a service


              -   Block  ( raw )  -  EBS    -  used to install  os from scratch
𝐬𝐭𝐨𝐫𝐚𝐠𝐞        -   File           -  EFS     -  no low level access  ie. partition access and format access
              - Object Storage    -  S3     -   no low level access  ie. partition access and format access   



                          -    Empheral      -    C:
𝐁𝐥𝐨𝐜𝐤 𝐒𝐭𝐨𝐫𝐚𝐠𝐞    (𝐄𝐁𝐒)     
                           -  Persistent     -    Pendrive


In an any of the instance we launch . to make some data in the instance to be permanent  we attach an EBS volume which  exists even after the termination of OS




𝐟𝐝𝐢𝐬𝐤   -𝐥        :   command to know the no of hard disks attached to the instance

𝐟𝐝𝐢𝐬𝐤   /𝐝𝐞𝐯/𝐱𝐯𝐝𝐢        and  followed by the options     n , size(ex:+2GiB)   , p , w  :  here   /dev/xvdi    is the name of hard disk

              command used for partition of the drive to required size
          
𝐦𝐤𝐟𝐬.𝐞𝐱𝐭𝟒   /𝐝𝐞𝐯/𝐱𝐯𝐝𝐢       :   command used for formattig the  drive 

𝐦𝐨𝐮𝐧𝐭   /𝐝𝐞𝐯/𝐱𝐯𝐝𝐢      <𝐟𝐨𝐥𝐝𝐞𝐫 𝐧𝐚𝐦𝐞 >        :      used to mount partitioned volume to particular folder 
  
𝐝𝐟  -𝐡𝐓       :  used for the drivers info of that particular instance
  
Create some data in the folder for which the EBS volume is attached and terminate the instance   but the EBSvolume still exists  in volumes 
  
  create an instance  and attach this EBS volume   to the new instance and check the data by connecting to the instance
  
  
  The process of connecting EBS storage from one instance to another   is  as follows 
   
       OS1  ( NIC card ) ( Dest OS   )     --------------  ISCSI  /  FC    protocol   -----------------   OS2  ( SAN  )   (Source OS )
  
  
  
  
  to make the process  faster the storage  and the computing should be  closer    
  
  
  
   we cannot attach the EBS volume  from instance in one region  to instance in other region      for such case  we use  snapshots
