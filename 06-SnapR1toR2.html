Launch an instance in Mumbai region    

create a EBS   volume   ,   attach it to the instance in mumbai region  ,  make partitions and mount it to any of the folder and add some data  

create a snapshot  for the volume  and copy this snapshot to the virginia region   

Launch an instance in virginia region and create a volume with the snapshot copied to this volume and atach this volume to the instance created in the virginia region and 
and mount the partition to any of the folder then we can see the data that is added to the partition from the instance in mumbai region

when we delete a snapshot then their might be loss of data  added in it so to restore even if it is deleted  we need to store it temporarily where we use 𝐫𝐞𝐜𝐲𝐜𝐥𝐞 𝐛𝐢𝐧 

to get the service of recycle bin we  use 𝐫𝐞𝐭𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐫𝐮𝐥𝐞 


when the snapshot having retention rule will be stored in recycle bin and can be recovered when needed 

we can create the retention table by specifying the snapshot as tag so that the rule can be applied for only 


we create an Archieve to the snapshot to change the type of storage or storage tier as per requirement to minimize the charges 


Launch an instance and install the packages required and modify the settings and security features   and create an image with the instance    
        so that when their is a requirement of multiple instances with same specifications we can launch the instances with this image to get all features 

        we can share this image from the permissions so that other users can create the instance using this image
