𝐕𝐏𝐂 𝐏𝐞𝐞𝐫𝐢𝐧𝐠  :  It is a network connection   between two  VPC's  either  they are in  the same network   or we can   create   a vpc peering with  a vpc  
                 in  another  AWS account  or can be in different  regions

VPC    have the feature of multi-system tenancy

for vpc  peering the IP   of two VPC's should in different regions  or different range


Launching a VPC Wazard ( N.virginia)  with the following selection of options  

                      vpc and more  -  2,2,0    , None  , None  , and we customize the CIDR  blocks  

Launch an Ec2 instance using he VPC created  with enabling public ip  and select All traffic in tabs  



Go to mumbai region  
          peering connectrions   >  connect to peer connection 

          select the pvc(of mumbai region )  in local peer option   , My account , Another region  ,  select   N.Virginia  , select VPC Id of virginia  and create

by the above process  the a peer request from mumbai region will be initiated 


Go to virginia region  and in peering  connection   it shows their is a request for peering go to it and in action  select accept the request


But even after completing the peering connection both cannot ping to each other to ping each other    we have to update the routing table of the subnets 
        of both sides which are to be connected each other   then both subnets will connect to each other  in each subnet add to 
        route rule of peering connection
