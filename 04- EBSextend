We can modify the volume size  to increase at any instant but cannot be decreased  

      since we can extend the storage  in only the increasing order which refers elastic property   it said to be elastic block storage

   when we modify the volume it will not be updated  or extended   to the folder it attached to   and  to   add  that  we use  a command

      Hard Disk is similar to the bottle neck    
      
      
                    if 10 GB  of the data   is loaded in RAM  and the 1GB is loaded further     the 1GB  will be on wait   if  the initial 10 GB  is not loaded 
                                  completely in   RAM
