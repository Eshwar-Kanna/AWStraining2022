        Connecting to a drive refers that Connecting to a  partition and connecting to a file system 



  𝐈𝐍𝐎𝐃𝐄 𝐑𝐮𝐥𝐞     :    It is the table where it store the address of the hard disk and when we need the data it connects to  Inode table and it provides 
                       the address of data  to retrive required data from that address

  
                        𝐄𝐁𝐒    :  ISCSI / FC (fulfillment center)   -   Raw hard disk   -   SAN ( storage Area Network ) -  Manual partition & Format 
   
                                     -   Fixed Data Storage   - charges for the entire hard disk provided   
                                                       
    𝐒𝐭𝐨𝐫𝐚𝐠𝐞             𝐄𝐅𝐒    :    NFS  ( Network File System )    -   file data    -     Pre formatted Hard disk   -   NAS  ( network attached storage)
                        
                                        -    similarly infinite storage   - charges only for the used storage   -  known as  File servers 


                        𝐒𝟑 (simple storage service )    -  Object / cloud storage   - HTTP   -  Manage all file systems in cloud 




We can only able to perform the CRUD operations when the storage supports or has http protocal  in which S3  has this support and used for such operations 


when we open any application . internally it goes to the file system   and connects Inode table to get the address of the data

 
𝐅𝐢𝐥𝐞 𝐄𝐧𝐜𝐫𝐲𝐩𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧   :  Locking a file or Hashing the data from Public access 

𝐊𝐌𝐒   :  Key Management  Service  :   is the service that used for encryption and decryption 

          Encryption of data can be done  when the data is at rest  or data is in Transit  


AWS  gives us the feature of 𝐁𝐥𝐨𝐜𝐤 𝐄𝐧𝐜𝐫𝐲𝐩𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧   where the data is stored as block wise in the hard disk 


To get Encryption of data .  we enable the option of encryption while creating the volume   or  while creating snapshot for existing non encrypted volumes 

EBS   has an advantage of 𝐌𝐮𝐥𝐭𝐢 𝐀𝐭𝐭𝐚𝐜𝐡   where the same volume can be attached to multiple instances but only  for the instances in same region 


EBS  is a 𝐙𝐨𝐧𝐞 𝐁𝐚𝐬𝐞𝐝 𝐒𝐞𝐫𝐯𝐢𝐜𝐞   in which it is connected to the instanes running  in the same region

EBS never Provide Replication  Bydefault     :  Third party apps should  be used for the replication
