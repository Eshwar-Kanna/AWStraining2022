    𝐈𝐏𝐕𝟒    :     4  Octate  :  2^32  Ips  can be created in this version   :    _._._._   :  in each octate we can have  0-255  :  0.0.0.0/0  represents all IPV4 ips in the world


    𝐈𝐏𝐕𝟔   :   8  octate   : 2^128   Ips  can be created in this version   :     _._._._._._._._    :  in each  we can have  0000-ffff    :  ::/0  represent all IPV6  ips  in the world

    1. Physical connectivity  ( wire / wireless )      
    2. NIC card 
    3. IPV4 / IPV6   
    4. Switch  /  Router  
    5. Private Ip ( free but cannot be connected to outer world ) /  Public  Ip   (  connected  to outer world but can be charged  )
    6. Routing Table  


Internet gateway is the  service helps in connecting to outer world  

    𝐂𝐈𝐃𝐑  :  The network range we provide for subnets 

    Create  a  VPC   in a range  of CIDR   -  192.168.0.0/16   
    Create  a Subnet  in a range of VPC     - 192.168.1.0/24     in  1a region 
    Create  a Subnet  in a range of VPC     - 192.168.2.0/24     in  1b region 


if its 8 then the netmask becomes   255.255.255.0
if its 16 then the netmask becomes   255.255.0.0   
if its 24 then the netmask becomes   255.0.0.0   


      when we launch an instance in the subnet created .it get the Ip address in the range of subnet  


in    0 - 255   we can only use  251  in which   0 - N/w  Id   ,  1  - Router  ,  2 - DHCP  ,    3  -    ,  255   -   .
